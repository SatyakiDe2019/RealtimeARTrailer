# Real-time Augmented Reality using Computer Vision

## About this app

This computer-vision app will augment a trailer with audio along with the video or Web-CAM in real-time streaming. This application developed using Open-CV. This project is for the intermediate Python developer & Data Science Newbi's.


## How to run this app

(The following instructions apply to Posix/bash. Windows users should check
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).)

First, clone this repository and open a terminal inside the root folder.

Create and activate a new virtual environment (recommended) by running
the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
